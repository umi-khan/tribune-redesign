== Description ==
Displays a customizable bar with WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook and Google+ share buttons on top or bottom of your website.

= More and more traffic =
By using the Mobile ShareBar you get more and more social traffic to your website! Users will share your good content by using the best-visual-buttons of Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and WhatsApp with their friends. Especially WhatsApp is nearly the best way to share websites on smartphones.

= WhatsApp Sharing for iPhone and Android Smartphones =
Currently the WhatsApp Button only works on iPhones and Smartphones using the newest Android version. So it will be displayed only to those who access your page with one of these phones.
It appears when user scrolls down on your page.

= Realtime Preview =
You can edit the ShareBar and see the results in real-time (currently not working with custom CSS).

= Post-Types =
You can select specific post-types where you want the ShareBar to appear.
It supports: the frontpage, posts, pages, categories, archives, tags and custom-post-types.
By choosing custom-post-types you can declare each one individual by its name.

= Have fun with this Plugin =
... and thank you for your good rating and review!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `mobile-sharebar` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the WordPress Mobile ShareBar plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin by going to the `Mobile ShareBar` menu that appears in your admin-settings menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I set a custom-sharetext for a single post? =
Yes, sure! In the post-editor you can see a box to set a unique sharetext for the Twitter and WhatsApp-Share-Button. If you leave it blank, the plugin will use the global settings.
If the box doesn't show up, please check the "Options" in the admin-bar above the editor and activate the checkbox "Custom ShareText".

= Does it work with WPTouch? =
Yes, it works!

= There are some bugs in main-menu or other display-issues? =
Try to disable jQuery in the plugin-settings. That should fix it.
